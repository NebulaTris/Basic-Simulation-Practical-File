## EXPERIMENT 1(B)
Performing Arithmetic Operations-Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication and Exponentiation
## EXPERIMENT 1(C)
Performing Matrix Operation-Inverse,Transpose,Rank.

# :two:
## EXPERIMENT-2(A)
Performing Matrix Manipulations-Concatenating,Indexing,Sorting,Shifting,Reshaping,Resizing and Flipping about a Vertical Axis/Horizontal Axis.
## EXPERIMENT-2(B)
Creating Arrays X & Y of given size (1 x N) and Performing Relational Operations- >,<,==,<=,>=,~=
## EXPERIMENT-2(C)
Creating Arrays X & Y of given size (1 x N) and Performing Logical Operations- ~,&,|,XOR

# :three:
## EXPERIMENT-3(A)
Generating a set of Commands on a given Vector(Example: X=[1 8 3 9 0 1]) to add up the values of the elements(Check with sum)
## EXPERIMENT-3(B)
Generating a set of Commands on a given Vector(Example: X=[1 8 3 9 0 1]) to compute the Running Sum(Check with sum), where Running Sum for element j = the sum of the elements from 1 to j,inclusive.
## EXPERIMENT-3(C)
Generating a Random Sequence using rand()/randn() functions and plotting them.

# :four:
## EXPERIMENT-4(A)
Evaluating a given expression and rounding it to the nearest integer value using Round,Floor,Ceil and Fix Functions.
## EXPERIMENT-4(B)
Generating and Plots of Trigonometric Functions-sin(t),cos(t),tan(t),sec(t),cosec(t) and cot(t) for a given duration, 't'.
## EXPERIMENT-4(C)
Generating and Plots of Logarithmic and other Functions-log(A),log10(A),Square Root of A,Real nth root of A.

# :five:
Creating a vector X with elements, Xn=(-1)^(n+1)/(2n-1) and Adding up 100 elements of the vector, X; And,plotting the functions, x,x^3,e^x,exp(x^2) over the interval 0<x<4 (by choosing appropriate mesh values for x to obtain smooth curves), on A Rectangular Plot.

# :six:
Generating a Sinusoidal Signal of a given frequency (say,100Hz) and Plotting with Graphical Enhancements;Titling, Labeling,Adding Text,Adding Legends,Adding New Plots to Existing Plot,Printing Text in Greek Letters,Plotting as Multiple and Subplot.

# :seven:
Generating a Square Wave from sum of Sine Waves of certain Amplitude and Frequencies.

# :eight:
Solving First, Second and third Order Ordinary Differential Equation using Built-in Functions and plot.

# :nine:
Writing brief Scripts starting each Script with a request for input(using input) to Evaluate the function h(T) using if-else statement, where h(T)=(T-10), for 0<T<100 =().45T+900),for T>100
Exercise: Testing the scripts written using A)T=5,h=-5 B)T=110,h=949.5

# :keycap_ten:
Basic 2D and 3D plots: parametric space curve, polygons with vertices, 3D contour lines, pie and bar charts.

# OPEN-ENDED :books:
Given the data about Blood Pressure and Cholesterol for 20 patients, using k-means clustering to group the patients into having high risk of heart attack and those having low risk of heart attack.
